# PhysicsSim

Try the simulator [here](https://zioul123.github.io/PhysicsSim/Engine/)!

This is a simple Physics Simulator written in p5.js. Currently, it supports:
- Point particles
- Spring forces
- Gravity (directional/between particles)
- Air drag

Examples for setting up a scene can be found [here](/Engine/SceneTests.js).

Credits: This simulator's structure and equations used are heavily based on the assignments/content taught in the course (Animation and CGI Motion)[https://www.edx.org/course/animation-and-cgi-motion-2].
